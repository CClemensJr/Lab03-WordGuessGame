# Word Guess Game
```
	Guess the random word!
```

## Problem Domain
```
Josie Cat has requested that a “Word Guess Game” be built. The main idea of the game is she must guess what a mystery word is by inputting (1) letter at a time. The game should save all of her guesses (both correct and incorrect) throughout each session of the game, along with the ability to show her how many letters out of the word she has guessed correctly.

Each time a new game session starts, the mystery word chosen should come from an external text file that randomly selects one of the words listed. This bank of words should be editable by Josie so that she may view, add, and delete words as she wishes. She expects the game to have a simple user interface that is easy to navigate.

Using everything you’ve learned up to this point, create a word guess game that will meet all of the requirements described in the user story above.
```

## Usage
```
	1. Use the number of blank spaces to think of a word that may fit.
	2. Enter a letter.
	3. If the letter is in the word then it will replace a previously blank space. Congrats!
	4. Repeat this process until the spaces have been filled and the word revealed!
```

## Installation
```
	1. Clone the Repo.
	2. Open solution in Visual Studio
	3. Run solution in debug mode
